          <h4>Coding</h4>
          <p>
            Writing code isn't just a career for me. It's something that I love
            to do. I spend my time honing my skill set and developing my
            knowledge daily.

          <h4>Music</h4>
          <p>
            I love playing, recording, and producing music. I've experienced the
            world as a traveling musician and met some extraordinary people
            along the way.

          <h4>Yak-Fishing</h4>
          <p>
            Growing up on the water it's the place I feel most at home. I
            fishing both freshwater and saltwater on an Eddyline Caribbean 14
            kayak decked to the nine! The best things in life come with a little
            bit of patience.

            I love my 2019 69-cubic-inch, 100-horsepower V-Twin Indian Scout

            a bike like this going flat out than some people live in a

          <h4>Fitness</h4>
          <p>
            Fitness is a lifestyle that I've invested in my whole life. I'm been

            in 5k's, and have competed in mud runs.
